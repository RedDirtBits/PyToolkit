# PyToolkit

The PyToolkit is my stab at some Web Frontend creation for a few of my Python applications.  For now it's just the HTML but the longer term goal is to build a [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/) application around this to provide something of a toolkit I can spin up and provide access to various utilities and automations built in Pyhon.

This is very early stage work and I decided to see what I could do on the HTML front first.
